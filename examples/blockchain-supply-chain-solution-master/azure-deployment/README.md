# Azure Deployment script
PowerShell script for deploying ARM templates to create the Supply Chain solution in Azure.

## Pre Requisites
To run the deployment script, please make sure you have the following pre-requisites:
1.	PowerShell to run the script
2.  Azure PowerShell [info](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps)
3.	Node.js v8.4 or later
4.  Git client
5.	Azure subscription

## Getting Started
To be able to start the deployment, there are several operations that you must perform:
1. Fork the repositories into your private GitHub account. Please be sure to fork all the 4 repositories from their master branches:
    - The main repository: [blockchain-supply-chain-solution](https://github.com/Azure/blockchain-supply-chain-solution)
    - [supply-chain-office-integration](https://github.com/Azure/supply-chain-office-integration)
    - [supply-chain-services](https://github.com/Azure/supply-chain-services)
    - [supply-chain-smart-contracts](https://github.com/Azure/supply-chain-smart-contracts)

2. Clone the main repository `blockchain-supply-chain-solution` from your account (the forked repository).

3. Open the `deploy.conf` file and modify the links of the keys: `gitSmartContractsRepoURL`, `mainRepositoryLocation`, `gitServicesRepoURL` and `gitOiRepoURL`, according to the forked repositories under your account (Generally you only need to replace 'Azure' in these links, with your account name in GitHub).

4. You must at least one time manually integrate a webapp in Azure with a repository under your account in GitHub. This is a one time integration in order to sign Azure Portal as an authorized OAuth Application under your GitHub account. 
    - To manually integrate a webapp in Azure with a repository in GitHub, simply add a new webapp in Azure, go to "Deployment options" of that webapp and click "Setup", click "Choose Source", click on "GitHub", in "Choose your organiztion" Choose you Personal account, in "Choose project" click on any of the projects there, and then click "OK".
    - To see the the authorized applications under your GitHub account you can go to your profile "Settings" in your GitHub account, click on "Applications" on the left side list, and then click on "Authorized OAuth Apps" tab (you can also click [here](https://github.com/settings/applications)).

## Running the script
To deploy the solution in Azure, make sure you have the pre-requisites listed in the beginning of this document, and make sure you set the required deployment parameters in the `deploy.conf` file, and then follow these steps:
1.	Open PowerShell.

2.	Login to Azure using the following command in the PowerShell command line:
    ```
    > Login-AzureRmAccount
    ```
    This will open the azure login page in you default web browser. Please enter your credentials and login.

3.	After logging in, the default subscription will be used. If you have more than one subscription, and wish to use another subscription, use the following command in the PowerShell command line:
    ```
    > Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId <your subscription id>
    ```

4.	Change directory (cd) to the azure-deployment directory (to this directory where the deployScript.ps1 exists).

5.	Run the deployScript.ps1 script with this command:
    ```
    > .\deployScript.ps1
    ```
    The deployment starts, and it will take between 1-2 hours to complete, mainly according to the provided deployment type (ASE takes more time), and according to the provided configurations of the Ethereum Consortium.

After the deployment completed, login to your Azure account, and search for the Resource Group name you provided. Youâ€™ll find the resources under it.

[Go back](https://github.com/Azure/blockchain-supply-chain-sloution) to the main repository.
