**Smart contracts library for supply chain management.** These are meant to be used mostly as educational resources for developers getting started in this space.

## Getting Started

To get started, navigate through the existing contracts and feel free to copy those that you like. You can deploy these contracts using truffle or get started using Remix.

- [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/)
- [Remix Editor](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&version=soljson-v0.5.0+commit.1d4f565a.js)

### Prerequisites

A basic understanding of Ethereum, solidity, and smart contracts is all you will need to get started.

- [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)
- [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/)
- [Smart Contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract)

### Installing

There is currently no installation for this library but feel free to fork, clone, or download as you like.

```
git clone https://github.com/joenyzio/2chains.git
```

## Deployment

These contracts are not audited and it is not recommended that you deploy them as written to the live network. For practice you can deploy to the Ethereum test networks, or on a local blockchain using ganache.

## Built With

- [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.0/) - Programming language for smart contracts
